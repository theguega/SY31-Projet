### **TurtleBot Maze Mapping Using ROS**

### **Description**
This project implements maze mapping for a **TurtleBot** using **ROS (Robot Operating System)**. The TurtleBot explores and maps an unknown maze environment while relying on various sensors for navigation, including a **camera**, **odometry**, **LiDAR**, and **ultrasound** sensors. The project is designed to simulate autonomous robot behavior for mapping and navigating complex environments.


### **Sensors Used**

- **Camera**: Provides visual input for object detection and recognizing walls.
- **Odometry**: Tracks the TurtleBotâ€™s movement and position in the maze.
- **LiDAR**: Maps the environment by detecting walls and obstacles with high precision.
- **Ultrasound**: Measures distances to close obstacles, complementing LiDAR data.
